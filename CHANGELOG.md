- **Template-based Procedural Name Generation**: Implemented a new template system for generating names dynamically using placeholders and component libraries
  - Supports simple placeholder syntax like `{metal}{building}` that gets replaced with random values from component lists
  - Added support for filter syntax `{placeholder|filter}` to prepare for future grammar features (declensions, cases, etc.)

- **Dwarf Settlements: Procedural Beta**: Added experimental procedural generation for dwarf settlements
  - New "Prozedural (Beta)" subcategory in German dwarf settlements with 9 different template patterns

  - Generates authentic-sounding names like "Eisenschmiede", "Goldhalle der Steinklaue", "Steinburg", "Festung Mithrilgrube"
  - All existing static settlement entries remain unchanged

### Changed
- Updated `NamesDataManager.getSubcategoryData()` to return full subcategory objects when templates are present (instead of just entries array)
